###Stage 1 - Github

* ~~Download this file~~
* ~~Create a free github account.~~
* ~~Download the OS X Github App.~~
* ~~Create a new github project.~~
* ~~Add a folder including this file to the github project, and push it to the master branch.~~
* ~~Change this file into a 'markdown' file and rename it to "README.md". Make sure it is in the root/base of the github project, and then push it to the master branch.~~
* ~~Add Tobie as admin~~


###Stage 2

* ~~Create a PHP file which is HTML, but has certain dynamic elements inside it.~~
* ~~Create a PHP file which is pure PHP, and links to a smarty template file.~~

###Stage 3

* ~~Signup for twitter API.~~
* ~~Create PHP file which gets latest 30 tweets for a user/handle.~~
* ~~For every tweet output it directly from PHP using 'echo'.~~
* ~~Next, output the tweets using smarty, in a nicely designed page.~~
* ~~Add in a 'text field' where the user can change the twitter handle, and it will get the entered user's tweets. Store the selected 'twitter handle' in a cookie.~~
* Use javascript and the HTML5 Local storage api, to store the tweets retrieved from Twitter, and only fetch/refresh tweets every 10 minutes. Therefore you will need to store when the last 'synced' time was.
